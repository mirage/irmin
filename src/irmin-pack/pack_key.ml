  (** [unfindable_of_hash h] is a key [k] such that [to_hash k = h], with an
      unspecified internal representation. This function enables an efficient
      implmentation of "portable" inodes, but is otherwise unused. Attempting to
      dereference a key constructed in this way results in undefined behaviour.
