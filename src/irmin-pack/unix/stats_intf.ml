      [steps] is the list of all step names associated with the timing of these

      used here instead of types because in the future the exact list of tasks
      may change and we don't want the rigidity of types, especially because
      these informations will end up appearing in a file format.

      Since the worker lives in a fork, [rusage] and [ocaml_gc] contain stats
      that are impacted by what happened in the main process, prior to the fork.
      The [init_*] fields reflect this.

      The total wall time of the worker is the sum of all [wall] fields in
      [steps].

      [files] contains the size of files created by the GC. And association list
      is used instead of plain types for the same reason as [steps]/

      [suffix_transfers] contains an int for each transfer loop to the new
      suffix. That integer corresponds to the number of bytes copied during that
      loop. The sum of these integers is equal to the "suffix" step in [files]. *)
