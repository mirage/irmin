  val freeze :
    ?min_lower:commit list ->
    ?max_lower:commit list ->

    ?recovery:bool ->
    repo ->
    unit Lwt.t
  (** [freeze ?min_lower ?max_lower ?min_upper ?max_upper ?recovery t] launches
      an asynchronous freezing operation on the repo [t] to reduce the size of
      the upper layer and discard unnecessary branches of objects (i.e. commits,
      nodes and contents).

      Let [o] be the set of objects reachable from the [max_lower] commits and
      bounded by the [min_lower] commits. During the freeze, all objects in [o]
      are copied to the lower layer, if there is one. [max_lower] defaults to
      the head commits of the repo and [min_lower] defaults to the empty list
      (i.e. the copy is unbounded). When [max_lower] is the empty list, nothing
      is copied.

      Let [o'] be the set of objects reachable from the [max_upper] commits and
      bounded by the [min_upper] commits. When the freeze is over, the new upper
      layer will only contain the objects of [o']. [max_upper] defaults to
      [max_lower] and [min_upper] defaults to [max_upper] (i.e. only the max
      commits are copied). When [max_upper] is the empty list, nothing is
      copied.

      If [recovery] is true then the function will first try to recover from a
      previously interrupted freeze. See {!needs_recovery}.

      If a freeze is already ongoing, the behavior depends on the
      freeze_throttle configuration of the repo:

      - When [`Overcommit_memory], the function returns without launching a new
        freeze.
      - When [`Cancel_existing], the function blocks until the ongoing freeze
        safely cancels and then a new one is started afterwards. The time spent
        doing the canceled freeze is not completely wasted, objects copied to
        the lower layer will not have to be copied again, but objects copied to
        the next upper layer are discarded from that layer.
      - When [`Block_writes], the function blocks until the ongoing freeze ends
        and then a new one is started afterwards. *)

  val async_freeze : repo -> bool
  (** [async_freeze t] returns true if there is an ongoing freeze. To be used
      with caution, as a freeze can start (or stop) just after the test. It is
      helpful when a single freeze is called, to check whether it completed or
      not. *)

  val self_contained : ?min:commit list -> max:commit list -> repo -> unit Lwt.t
  (** [self_contained min max t] copies the commits in the range of [min, max]
      from lower into upper, in order to make the upper self contained. If [min]
      is missing then only the [max] commits are copied. *)

  val check_self_contained :
    ?heads:commit list ->
    repo ->
    ([> `Msg of string ], [> `Msg of string ]) result Lwt.t
  (** [check_self_contained ?heads] checks that the current upper layer of a
      store is self contained. *)

  val needs_recovery : repo -> bool
  (** [needs_recovery repo] detects if an ongoing freeze was interrupted during
      the last node crash. If it returns [true] then the next call to freeze
      needs to have its [recovery] flag set. *)
