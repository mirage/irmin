  (** [iter depth min max node edge skip rev ()] iterates in topological order
      over the closure graph starting with the [max] nodes and bounded by the
      [min] nodes and by [depth].

      It applies three functions while traversing the graph: [node] on the
      nodes; [edge n predecessor_of_n] on the directed edges and [skip n] to not
      include a node [n], its predecessors and the outgoing edges of [n].

      If [rev] is true (the default) then the graph is traversed in the reverse
      order: [node n] is applied only after it was applied on all its
      predecessors; [edge n p] is applied after [node n]. Note that [edge n p]
      is applied even if [p] is skipped.

      [cache_size] is the size of the LRU cache used to store nodes already
      seen. If [None] (by default) every traversed nodes is stored (and thus no
      entries are never removed from the LRU). *)
