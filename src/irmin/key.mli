(** Module types for {i keys} into an arbitrary store.

    {2 Choices of key representation}

    {3 Hash-like keys}

    Most Irmin stores are keyed directly by a {i hash} of the values that they
    store. This results in a so-called "content-addressable" store, in which all
    possible contents values have exactly one key. The key is derived from the
    value via [hash] and, given a key, the corresponding value can be retrieved
    from the store via [find]:

    {[
                      ┌───────────────────────────────┐
                      │                               │
      ┌───────┐       v    find   ┌───────┐  hash   ┌─────┐
      │ Store │ ──>  (+)  ──────> │ Value │ ──────> │ Key │
      └───────┘                   └───────┘         └─────┘
    ]}

    Keys built this way – with a 1:1 correspondence between the key and the
    hash, are known as {!Hash_like}. This class of key representation has some
    important properties:

    - {b irredundant storage}: given that an object's key is derived directly
      from its representation, there can be at most one copy of any content
      value in the store at one time – the store is naturally free of
      duplicates.

    - {b reproducibility}: again, because keys are derived directly from values,
      multiple parties are guaranteed to compute the same store keys for a given
      set of stored values.

    However, it also has some disadvantages. Implementing a hash-keyed store
    requires some mechanism for mapping hashes to their physical location (e.g.
    their offset on disk), called an "index". This auxiliary index occupies
    space, and must be queried for each pointer in the store (even for internal
    pointers between nodes along a path).

    {3 Non-hash-like keys}

    For this reason, Irmin allows backends to supply custom key representations
    that do not satisfy the above properties (i.e. not irredundant, and not
    reproducible). This leads to the following more complex set of relationships
    between the values:

    {[
                     ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
                     │                                                        │
        ┌············┼··········································┐             │
        :            │                                          :             │
      ┌───────┐      v    find  ┌───────┐  hash   ┌──────┐      v   index   ┌─────┐
      │ Store │ ──> (+) ──────> │ Value │ ──────> │ Hash │ ··> (+) ·······> │ Key │
      └───────┘                 └───────┘         └──────┘                  └─────┘
        │                          v                 ∧        to_hash         │ ^
        └───────────────────────> (+)                └────────────────────────┘ │
                                   │       add                                  │
                                   └────────────────────────────────────────────┘
    ]}

    In general, the key of a value isn't known until it has been added to a
    particular store, and keys need not be portable between different stores.
    It's still required that keys be convertible to hashes, as this ensures the
    consistency of Irmin's Merkle tree structure.

    Note that stores that use non-hash-like keys are not content-addressable,
    since the user can't compute the key of a value given the value itself (and
    perhaps a value has more than one possible key). *)
