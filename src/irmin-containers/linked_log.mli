(** The linked list implementation of log. Due to the linked property, two
    versions of the log share their common predecessor. As it is a linked data
    structure, a content addressable store is required. Along with that, a
    method to obtain timestamps, a hash for the content addressable store and
    the type of values stored must also be provided. *)

(** Signature of [Linked_log] *)
module type S = sig
  include Blob_log.S
  (** @inline *)

  type cursor
  (** Type of cursor. Cursor is like a marker from which a certain number of
      entries can be read *)

  val get_cursor : path:Store.path -> Store.t -> cursor
  (** Create a new cursor over the log entires at the given path *)

  val read : num_items:int -> cursor -> value list * cursor
  (** Read at most [num_items] entries from the cursor. If the number specified
      is greater than the number of log entries from the cursor, the log is read
      till the end. If the input cursor has already reached the end, then an
      empty list is returned *)
