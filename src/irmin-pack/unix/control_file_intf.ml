      known to have been created using [irmin_pack_version = `V2] or more. The
      entries before that point may be v1 entries. V1 entries need an entry in
      index because it is the only place their lenght is stored. *)

      collected. Otherwise it is the offset of the very first entry of the
      suffix file. Note that offsets in the suffix file are virtual. The garbage
      collections don't reset the offsets.

      [gc_generation] is the number of past GCs. A suffix file and a prefix file
      containing that integer in their name exist. *)

  (** [From_v1_v2_post_upgrade] corresponds to a pack store that was upgraded to
      [`V3]. It contains infos related to backward compatibility. GCs are
      forbidden on it.

      TODO: Change to something better for future upgrades.

      [from_v3_gc_disallowed] corresponds to a pack store that was created using
      [`V3] code. GCs are forbidden on it because it uses an indexing strategy.

      [from_v3_gc_allowed] corresponds to a pack store that was created using
      [`V3] code. GCs are possible on it, but the indexing strategy is
      constrained to minimal. *)
