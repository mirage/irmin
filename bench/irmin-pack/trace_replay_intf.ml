  (** Replay configuration

      [replay_trace_path] points to a specific file that describes the sequence
      of operations to replay. You may download one of the following URLs. The
      smaller ones are prefix of the larger ones.

      - http://data.tarides.com/irmin/data4_10310commits.repr (0.3GB)
      - http://data.tarides.com/irmin/data4_100066commits.repr (2.9GB)
      - http://data.tarides.com/irmin/data_1343496commits.repr (102GB)

      [number_of_commits_to_replay] is the wished number of commits to replay.
      If the value is too high, the replay will stop when reaching the end of
      [replay_trace_path]. Pick a number of commits depending on the wished
      runtime. Here are some reference runtimes that were true for irmin 3.0:

      - [60_457] commits take 3 minutes
      - [500_000] commits take 1 hour
      - [1_343_496] commits take 5 hours

      [artefacts_path] is the destination for the stats trace and the store. If
      both [keep_store] and [keep_stat_trace] are false, the destination will be
      emptied at the end of the replay.

      [path_conversion] is the strategy for shortening the paths while
      replaying. Was useful when benchmarking irmin on flattened Tezos paths.

      [empty_blobs] make the replay to push the empty string as in all the
      blobs, instead of their actual value read in the trace.

      [inode_config] is a pair of ints that will be stored in the results of the
      replay.

      A GC is triggered every [gc_every] commits. When GC is triggered, we
      select a previous commit that is [gc_distance_in_the_past] commits away
      from the current head commit.

      The first GC will be started after [gc_distance_in_the_past + 1] commits
      were replayed. [gc_distance_in_the_past] only makes sense if [gc_every] is
      not [0].

      [gc_wait_after] defines how many commits separate the start of a GC and
      the moment we block to wait for it to finish. [0] means that we will only
      block when the next gc starts or at the end of the replay. This parameter
      only makes sense if [gc_every] is not [0]. *)
