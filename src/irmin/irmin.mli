(** Irmin public API.

    [Irmin] is a library to design and use persistent stores with
    built-in snapshot, branching and reverting mechanisms. Irmin uses
    concepts similar to {{:http://git-scm.com/}Git} but it exposes
    them as a high level library instead of a complex command-line
    frontend. It features a {e bidirectional} Git backend, where an
    application can read and persist its state using the Git format,
    fully-compatible with the usual Git tools and workflows.

    Irmin is designed to use a large variety of backends. It is
    written in pure OCaml and does not depend on external C stubs; it
    is thus very portable and aims to run everywhere, from Linux to
    browser and MirageOS unikernels.

    Consult the {!basics} and {!examples} of use for a quick
    start. See also the {{!Irmin_unix}documentation} for the unix
    backends.

  (** Yet-an-other type combinator library

      [Type] provides type combinators to define runtime

      representation.

      The type combinators supports all the usual {{!primitives}type

      and {{!variants}variants}. It also allows to define the runtime
      representation of {{!recursive}recursive types}. *)

      [Type] allows to create a limited form of recursive records and

      {b TODO}: describe the limitations, e.g. only regular recursion

      about.

  (** Similar to {!dump} but pretty-prints the JSON representation instead

      {ul
      {- OCaml [ints] are translated into JSON floats.}

(** {1 High-level Stores}

    An Irmin store is a branch-consistent store where keys are lists
    of steps.

    An example is a Git repository where keys are filenames, {e i.e.}
    list of ['/']-separated strings. More complex examples are
    structured values, where steps might contain first-class field
    accessors and array offsets.

    Irmin provides the following features:

    {ul
    {- Support for fast clones, branches and merges, in a fashion very
       similar to Git.}
    {- Efficient taging areas for fast, transient, in-memory operations.}
    {- Fast {{!Sync}synchronization} primitives between remote
       stores, using native backend protocols (as the Git protocol)
       when available.}
    }
*)

(** Irmin stores. *)

  (** {1 Irmin stores}

      Irmin stores are tree-like read-write stores with
      extended capabilities. They allow an application (or a
      collection of applications) to work with multiple local states,
      which can be forked and merged programmatically, without having
      to rely on a global state. In a way very similar to version
      control systems, Irmin local states are called {i branches}.

      There are two kinds of store in Irmin: the ones based on
      {{!persistent}persistent} named branches and the ones based
      {{!temporary}temporary} detached heads. These exist relative to a
      local, larger (and shared) store, and have some (shared)
      contents. This is exactly the same as usual version control
      systems, that the informed user can see as an implicit purely
      functional data-structure. *)

        [depth] is used to limit the depth of the commit history. [None]

    A log file is a list of entries (one per line), ordered by
    decreasing order of timestamps. The 3-way [merge] operator for log
    files concatenates and sorts the new entries and prepend them
    to the common ancestor's ones.

          | Error (`Msg e) -> failwith e
        ) [] lines
      |> fun l -> Ok l

      Error (`Msg e)

    {b Note:} The serialisation primitives used in that example are
    not very efficient in this case as they parse the file
    every-time. For real usage, you would write buffered versions of
    [Log.pp] and [Log.of_string].

    To persist the log file on disk, we need to choose a backend. We
    show here how to use the on-disk [Git] backend on Unix.

{[
  (* Build an Irmin store containing log files. *)
  module S = Irmin_unix.Git.FS.KV(Log)

  (* Set-up the local configuration of the Git repository. *)
  let config = Irmin_git.config ~bare:true "/tmp/irmin/test"

  (* Set-up the commit info function *)
  let info fmt = Irmin_unix.info ~author:"logger" fmt
]}

  We can now define a toy example to use our mergeable log files.

{[
  open Lwt.Infix

  (* Name of the log file. *)
  let file = [ "local"; "debug" ]

  (* Read the entire log file. *)
  let read_file t =
    S.find t file >|= function
    | None   -> []
    | Some l -> l

  (* Persist a new entry in the log. *)
  let log t fmt =
    Fmt.kstrf (fun message ->
        read_file t >>= fun logs ->
        let logs = Log.add logs (Entry.v message) in
        S.set t (info "Adding a new entry") file logs
      ) fmt

  let () =
    Lwt_main.run begin
      S.Repo.v config >>= S.master
      >>= fun t  -> log t "Adding a new log entry"
      >>= fun () -> Irmin.clone_force ~src:t ~dst:"x"
      >>= fun x  -> log x "Adding new stuff to x"
      >>= fun () -> log x "Adding more stuff to x"
      >>= fun () -> log x "More. Stuff. To x."
      >>= fun () -> log t "I can add stuff on t also"
      >>= fun () -> log t "Yes. On t!"
      >>= fun () -> S.merge (info "Merging x into t") x ~into:t
      >|= function Ok () -> () | Error _ -> failwith "merge conflict!"
    end

(** {1:backend Backends}

    API to create new Irmin backends. A backend is an implementation
    exposing either a concrete implementation of {!S} or a functor
    providing {!S} once applied.

    There are two ways to create a concrete {!Irmin.S} implementation:

    {ul
    {- {!Make} creates a store where all the objects are stored in the
    same store, using the same internal keys format and a custom binary
    format based on {{:https://github.com/janestreet/bin_prot}bin_prot},
    with no native synchronization primitives: it is usually what is
    needed to quickly create a new backend.}
    {- {!Make_ext} creates a store with a {e deep} embedding of each
    of the internal stores into separate store, with total control over
    the binary format and using the native synchronization protocols
    when available.}
