    - [finds] is the number of calls to [S.find];
    - [cache_misses] is the number of times a cache miss occured during calls to
      [S.find];
    - [appended_hashes] is the number of times a hash was appended, during calls

    - [appended_offsets] is the number of times an offset was appended, during
      calls to [add];

    [appended_hashes] + [appended_offsets] = the number of calls to [add] *)
