      remove elements, with atomically guarantees. *)

  (** [set t k v] replaces the contents of [k] by [v] in [t]. If [k] is not
      already defined in [t], create a fresh binding. Raise [Invalid_argument]
      if [k] is the {{!Irmin.Path.S.empty} empty path}. *)

  val test_and_set : t -> key -> test:value option -> set:value option -> bool
  (** [test_and_set t key ~test ~set] sets [key] to [set] only if the current
      value of [key] is [test] and in that case returns [true]. If the current
      value of [key] is different, it returns [false]. [None] means that the
      value does not have to exist or is removed.

      {b Note:} The operation is guaranteed to be atomic. *)

  (** [remove t k] remove the key [k] in [t]. *)

      the watch handler to be used with {!unwatch}. [init] is the optional
      initial values. It is more efficient to use {!watch_key} to watch only a
      single given key.*)

  (** [watch_key t k ?init f] adds [f] to the list of [t]'s watch handlers for
      the key [k] and returns the watch handler to be used with {!unwatch}.
      [init] is the optional initial value of the key. *)

  val unwatch : t -> watch -> unit
  (** [unwatch t w] removes [w] from [t]'s watch handlers. *)
