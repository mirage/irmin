0.9.2
* The [head] argument of [Git_unix.config] now has a proper type.
* Expose synchronisation functions for basic Irmin stores
* The user-provided merge function now takes optional values. The
  function is now called much more often during recursive merges
  (even if one of the 3 buckets of the 3-way merge function is not
  filled -- in that case, it uses `None`).
* Also expose the type of the keys in the type basic Irmin stores. Use
  `('key, 'value) Irmint.t` instead of `'value Irmin.t`
* The user-defined `merge` functions now take the current filename being
  merged as an additional argument.
* The user-defined `Contents` should expose a `Path` sub-module. Keys of
  the resulting Irmin store will be of type `Path.t`.
* Fix `irmin init --help` (#103)

0.9.1 (2014-12-26)
* Port to Cohttp 0.14.0+ HTTP interface (#102)

0.9.0 (2014-12-20)
* Improve the efficiency of the Git backend
* Expose a cleaner API for the Unix backends
* Expose a cleaner public API
* Rename `Origin` into `Task` and use it pervasively through the API
* Expose a high-level REST API over HTTP (#80)
* Fix the Git backend to stop constantly overwrite `.git/HEAD` (#76)
* Add a limit on concurrently open files (#93, #75)
* Add `remove_rec` to remove directories (#74, #85)
* Remove dependency to `core_kernel` (#22, #81)
* Remove dependency to `cryptokit and `sha1` and use `nocrypto` instead
* Remove dependency to caml4
* Fix writing contents at the root of the store (#73)
* More efficient synchronization protocol between Irmin stores (#11)

0.8.3 (2014-06-25)
* Views now keep track of their parent commits - this makes
  View.merge_path looks like a merge between branches. All the
  view operations are squashed in a unique commit.
* Better graphs, where we only show the commit history (the
  full graph is still available using `--full` on the
  command-lineor or `?full=1` on the web interface)
* By default, do not call `dot` when dumping a graph on the
  command-line. `dot` does not like big graphs, but that's
  still useful to have the `.dot` file to analyze it.

0.8.2: (2014-06-11)
* Support backend specific protocols for push/pull
* The Irmin Git backend can now sync with remote Git repositories
* Simplify the organisation of the libraries: irmin, irmin.backend,
  irmin.server and irmin.unix (check how the example are compiled)
* Small refactoring to ease the use of the API. Now use `open Irmin_unix`
  at the top of your file and use less functor in your code (again,
  check the examples)

0.8.1: (2014-06-02)
* Fix the behavior of `IrminMemory.Make` to return an hanlder to a
  shared datastore instead of creating a fresh one. Add
  `IrminMemory.Fresh` to return a fresh in-memory datastore maker.
* The HTTP server now outputs some nice graph (using dagre-d3). Don't
  expect to display very large graphs
* More friendly tag names in the Git backend (no need to prefix
  everything by `refs/heads/` anymore)
* Partial support for recursive stores (WIP)

0.8.0: (2014-05-27)
* Spring clean-ups in the API. Separation in IrminBranch for
  fork/join operations, IrminSnapshot for snapshot/revert
  operations and IrminDump for import/export operations.
  The later two implementation can be derived automaticaly
  from a base IrminBranch implementation. The update and merge
  operations are supported on each backend
* IrminGit does not depend on unix anymore and can thus be
  compile to javascript or xen with mirage
* No need to have bin_io converter for contents anymore
* No need to have JSON converter for contents anymore
* No more IrminDispatch
* Add an optional branch argument to Irmin.create to use
  an already existing branch
* Fix order of arguments in Irmin.merge

0.7.0 (2014-05-02):
* Feature: support for in-memory transactions. They are built
  on top of views.
* Feature: add support for views: these are temporary stores with
  lazy reads + in-memory writes; they can be used to convert back
  and forth an OCaml value into a store, or to have a fast stagging
  area without the need to commit every operation to the store.
* Support custom messages in commit messages
* Improve the IrminMerge API
* Backend: add a 'dispatch' backend for combining multiple backends
  into one. This can be used to have a P2P store where there is
  well-defined mapping between keys and host (as a DHT).
* Fix: limit the number of simulteanous open files in the Git and
  the file-system backend
* Speed-up the in-memory store
* Speed-up the import/export codepath
* Speed-up the reads
* Speed-up IrminValue.Mux
* Deps: use ocaml-sha instead of cryptokit

0.6.0: (2014-04-12)
* Support for user-defined contents (with custom merge operators)
* Support for merge operations
* Rename `IrminTree` to `IrminNode` to reflect the fact that we
  can support arbitrary immutable graphs (it's better if they are
  DAGs but that's not mandatory)
* Rename `IrminBlob` to `IrminContents` to reflect the fact that
  we also support structured contents (as JSON objects)
* Support for linking the library without linking to camlp4 as well (#23)

0.5.1: (2014-03-02)
* Port to use Cohttp 0.10.0 interface.

0.5.0:
* More consistent support for notifications. `irmin watch` works
  now for all backends.
* Support for different blob formats on the command-line
* Support for JSON blobs
* More flexible `irmin fetch` command: we can now choose the backend to
  import the data in
* Fix import of Git objects when the blobs were not imported first
* Support non-UTF8 strings as path name and blob contents (for all
  backends, including the JSON one)
* Speed-up the `slow` tests execution time
* Improve the output graph when objects of different kinds might have
  the same SHA1

0.4: (2014-01-21)
* The command-line tool now looks in the environment for the variable
  `IRMIN` to configure its default backend
* Add a Git backend
* Add Travis CI scripts to the repo
* Use `Lwt_bytes` and `Lwt_unix` instead of the custom-made `IrminChannel`
* Use `bin_prot` instead of a custom binary protocol
* Major refactoring: `Value` is now `Blob`, `Revision` is now `Commit`
   and `Tag` becomes `Reference` (rational: consistency with Git names)
* Use `core_kernel` instead of building a custom `Identiable.S`
* Use `dolog` instead of a custom log library
* Use `mstruct` (mutable buffers on top of `cstruct`) which is now
  released independently

0.3: (2013-12-13)
* Fix a fd leak in the filesystem bakend
* Functorize the CRUD interface over the HTTP client implementation
* Use oasis to build the project
* Use the now released separately `ezjsonm` and `alcotest` libraries

0.2: (2013-11-23)
* Fix the HTTP server responses
* More high-level tests
* Add unit-tests for the client CRUD interfaces (over memory and/or filesystem)
* Fix issues with the Tree API
* Implement a relatively efficent Import/Export scheme (#3)
* For more safety, the marshalled values are now typed in the binary protocol
* Add functions to dump the contents of the store as a Graphviz graph
* Polish the CLI which now looks usable enough
* Optimize the CRUD backend by executing high-level API functions on the server
* Improve and make the CLI easier to use
* Implement clone/pull/push/snapshot/revert in the CLI

0.1: (2013-10-30)
* Use an HTTP server as a front-end
* Initial support for in-memory and filesystem backends
* Simple signature for backends
* Binary protocol for storing values and metadata and for future network exchange
