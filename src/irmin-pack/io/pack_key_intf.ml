        -> ('hash, safe) unsafe_state
        (** A "direct" pointer to a value stored at [offset] in the pack-file
            (with hash [hash] and length [length]). Such keys can be
            dereferenced from the store with a single IO read, without needing
            to consult the index.

            They are built in-memory (e.g. after adding a fresh value to the
            pack file), but have no corresponding encoding format, as the pack
            format keeps length information with the values themselves.

            When decoding a inode, which references its children as single
            offsets, we fetch the length information of the child at the same
            time as fetching its hash (which we must do anyway in order to do an
            integrity check), creating keys of this form. *)
    | Indexed : 'hash -> ('hash, safe) unsafe_state
        (** A pointer to an object in the pack file that is indexed. Reading the
            object necessitates consulting the index, after which the key can be
            promoted to {!Direct}.

            Such keys result from decoding pointers to other store objects
            (nodes or commits) from commits or from the branch store. *)
    | Offset : int63 -> ('hash, unsafe) unsafe_state
        (** Same as [Direct], but the hash and length of the object have not
            been fetched. Only used to speed up the GC traversal. *)

  (** {2 Undereferencable keys}

      A key [k] is "undereferencable" with respect to some store handle [t] if
      [find t k <> Some _]. Such keys should not arise during regular operation
      of a single Irmin repository, but are still technically constructible in
      the following ways:

      - {b storage corruption}. When decoding a key from disk, we may not
        immediately check that it is dereferenceable for performance reasons. In
        this case, any corruption to the key (or the referenced section of the
        store) will be discovered on attempted [find] (or [mem]).

      - {b passing keys between store handles}. Read-only handles on a pack
        store must explicitly {i reload} to observe recent writes to the store.
        This means that any keys built by a read-write instance and passed to a
        read-only instance will be undereferencable until that reader has
        reloaded.

      - {b passing keys between repositories}. Keys created for one Irmin
        repository may not be dereferenced with respect to another by design. *)
