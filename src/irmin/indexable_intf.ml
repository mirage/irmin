  type hash
  (** The type of hashes of [value]. *)

  val add : [> write ] t -> value -> key
  (** Write the contents of a value to the store, and obtain its key. *)

  val unsafe_add : [> write ] t -> hash -> value -> key
  (** Same as {!add} but allows specifying the value's hash directly. The
      backend might choose to discard that hash and/or can be corrupt if the
      hash is not consistent. *)

  val index : [> read ] t -> hash -> key option
  (** Indexing maps the hash of a value to a corresponding key of that value in
      the store. For stores that are addressed by hashes directly, this is
      typically [fun _t h -> Lwt.return (Key.of_hash h)]; for stores with more
      complex addressing schemes, [index] may attempt a lookup operation in the
      store.

      In general, indexing is best-effort and reveals no information about the
      membership of the value in the store. In particular:

      - [index t hash = Some key] doesn't guarantee [mem t key]: the value with
        hash [hash] may still be absent from the store;

      - [index t hash = None] doesn't guarantee that there is no [key] such that
        [mem t key] and [Key.to_hash key = hash]: the value may still be present
        in the store under a key that is not indexed. *)

module type S = sig
  (** An {i indexable} store is a read-write store in which values can be added

      Keys are not necessarily portable between different stores, so each store
      provides an {!val-index} mechanism to find keys by the hashes of the
      values they reference. *)
