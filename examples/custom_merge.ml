  "This example demonstrates custom merges on Irmin datastructures.\n\n\
   It models log files as a sequence of lines, ordered by timestamps.\n\n\
   The log files of `branch 1` and `branch 2` are merged by using the following \n\
   strategy:\n\
  \  - find the log file corresponding the lowest common ancestor: `lca`\n\
  \  - remove the prefix `lca` from `branch 1`; this gives `l1`;\n\
  \  - remove the prefix `lca` from `branch 2`; this gives `l2`;\n\
  \  - interleave `l1` and `l2` by ordering the timestamps; This gives `l3`;\n\
  \  - concatenate `lca` and `l3`; This gives the final result."
