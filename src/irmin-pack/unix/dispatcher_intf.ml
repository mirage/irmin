  val read_exn : t -> off:int63 -> len:int -> bytes -> unit
  (** [read_exn] either reads in the prefix or the suffix file, depending on
      [off]. See [Io.read_exn] for the arguments. If it tries to read a gced
      object, an exception is raised. *)

  val read_at_most_exn : t -> off:int63 -> len:int -> bytes -> int
  (** [read_at_most_exn] is similar to [read_exn] but if the end of file is
      reached while reading [len] bytes, then only the available bytes are read.
      No [`Read_out_of_bounds] error is raised. The number of bytes read are
      returned. *)

  val end_offset : t -> int63
  (** [end_offset] is the end offsets of the pack entries, counting that the
      prefix doesn't start at 0. It counts the entries not yet flushed from the
      prefix. *)

  val read_if_not_gced : t -> off:int63 -> len:int -> bytes -> bool
  (** Similar to [read_exn] but returns false if the object was gced, instead of
      raising an expection. *)

  val offset_of_suffix_off : t -> int63 -> int63
  (** [offset_of_suffix_off t suffix_off] converts a suffix offset into a
      (global) offset. *)

  val read_in_prefix_and_suffix_exn : t -> off:int63 -> len:int -> bytes -> unit
  (** Simlar to [read_exn] but if [off + len] is greater than the end of the
      prefix, it will read the remaining in the prefix. *)

  type mapping
  (** [mapping] is a map from global offset to [(offset,len)] pairs in the prefix file *)

  val load_mapping : string -> (mapping, [> Fm.Errs.t ]) result
  (** [load_mapping path] loads the [mapping] from the given path and returns it *)
