(** Irmin public API.

    [Irmin] is a library to design and use persistent stores with
    built-in snapshot, branching and reverting mechanisms. Irmin uses
    concepts similar to {{:http://git-scm.com/}Git} but it exposes
    them as a high level library instead of a complex command-line
    frontend. It features a {e bidirectional} Git backend,
    fully-compatible with the usual Git tools and workflows.

    Irmin is designed to use a large variety of backends. It is
    written in pure OCaml and does not depend on external C stubs; it
    is thus very portable and aims to run everywhere, from Linux to
    Xen unikernels.

    Consult the {!basics} and {!examples} of use for a quick
    start. See also the {{!Irmin_unix}documentation} for the unix
    backends.

        @raise Invalid_argument if the string does not represent
        anything meaningful. *)

(** Tasks are used to keep track of the origin of reads and writes in
    the store. Every high-level operation is expected to have its own
    task which is passed to every low-level call. *)
module Task: sig

  include Tc.S0

  val create: date:int64 -> owner:string -> ?uid:int64 -> string -> t
  (** Create a new task. *)

  val date: t -> int64
  (** Get the task date.

      The date provided by the user when calling the
      {{!Task.create}create} function.  Rounding [Unix.gettimeofday ()]
      (when available) is a good value for such date.  On more
      esoteric platforms, any monotonic counter is a fine value as
      well.  On the Git backend, the date is translated into the
      commit {e Date} field and is expected to be the number of
      POSIX seconds (thus not counting leap seconds) since the Epoch. *)

  val owner: t -> string
  (** Get the task owner.

      The owner identifies the entity (human, unikernel, process,
      thread, etc) performing an operation. For the Git backend, this
      will be directly translated into the {e Author} field. *)

  val uid: t -> int64
  (** Get the task unique identifier.

      By default, it is freshly generated on each call to
      {{!Task.create}create}. The identifier is useful for debugging
      purposes, for instance to relate debug lines to the tasks which
      cause them, and might appear in one line of the commit message
      for the Git backend. *)

  val messages: t -> string list
  (** Get the messages associated to the task.

      Text messages can be added to a task either at creation time,
      using {{!Task.create}create}, or can be appended on already
      created tasks using the {{!Task.add}add} function. For
      the Git backend, this will be translated to the commit

      {- Removing a binding from the map.}
      {- Replacing an existing binding with a different value.}
      {- {e Trying to add an already existing binding is a no-op}.}
      }

      We thus assume that no operation on maps is modifying the {e
      key} names. So the following merge functions ensures that {e
      (i)} new bindings are preserved {e (ii)} removed bindings stay
      removed and {e (iii)} modified bindings are merged using the
      merge function of values.

      {b Note:} We only consider sets of bindings, instead of
      multisets. Application developers should take care of concurrent
      addition and removal of similar bindings themselves, by using the
      appropriate {{!Merge.MSet}multi-sets}. *)

end

(** Branch-consistent stores. *)
module type BC = sig

  (** {1 Branch-consistent stores}

      Branch-consistent stores are hierarchical read-write stores with
      extended capabilities. They allow an application (or a
      collection of applications) to work with multiple local states,
      which can be forked and merged programmatically, without having
      to rely on a global state. In a way very similar to version
      control systems, Irmin local states are called {i branches}.

      There are two kinds of BC store in Irmin:
      {{!persistent}persistent} named branches and
      {{!temporary}temporary} detached heads. These exist relative to a
      local, larger (and shared) store, and have some (shared)
      contents. This is exactly the same as usual version control
      systems, that the informed user can see as an implicit purely
      functional data-structure.

      {2:persistent Persistent Branches}

      A persistent branch always has a unique ID, which is typically a
      string (the branch name). Thus, in order to use a persistent
      branch, you need to provide its name: see the {{!BC.of_branch_id}of_branch_id}
      function. *)

  type commit_id
  (** Type for commit identifiers. Similar to Git's commit SHA1s. *)

  type branch_id
  (** Type for persistent branch names. Branches usually share a common
      global namespace and it's the user's responsibility to avoid
      name clashes. *)

  type slice
  (** Type for store slices. *)

  module Repo: sig
    (** A repository contains a set of branches. *)

    type t
    (** The type of repository handles. *)

    val create: config -> t Lwt.t
    (** [create config] connects to a repository in a backend-specific manner. *)

    val branches: t -> branch_id list Lwt.t

        branch -a].*)

    val remove_branch: t -> branch_id -> unit Lwt.t
    (** [remove_branch t name] removes the branch [name] from the local store.
        Similar to [git branch -D <name>] *)

    val heads: t -> commit_id list Lwt.t
    (** [heads t] is the list of all the heads in local store. Similar
        to [git rev-list --all]. *)

      (branch_id -> commit_id diff -> unit Lwt.t) -> (unit -> unit Lwt.t) Lwt.t
    (** [watch_branches t f] calls [f] every time a branch is added, removed or
        updated in the local store. Return a function to remove the
        handler. *)

      t -> slice Lwt.t
    (** [export t ~depth ~min ~max] exports the store slice between
        [min] and [max], using at most [depth] history depth (starting
        from the max).

        If [max] is not specified, use the current [heads]. If [min] is
        not specified, use an unbound past (but can still be limited by
        [depth]).

        [depth] is used to limit the depth of the commit history. [None]
        here means no limitation.

        If [full] is set (default is true), the full graph, including the
        commits, nodes and contents, is exported, otherwise it is the
        commit history graph only. *)

    val import: t -> slice -> [`Ok | `Error] Lwt.t
    (** [import t s] imports the contents of the slice [s] in [t]. Does
        not modify branches. *)

    val task_of_commit_id: t -> commit_id -> task Lwt.t

      called {{!BC.head}heads} in Irmin. Temporary stores are
      similar to Git's detached heads. In a temporary store, all the
      operations are performed relative to the current head and update
      operations can modify the current head: the current stores's
      head will automatically become the new head obtained while
      performing the update.

      Temporary stores are created using the {!BC.of_head}
      function. *)

  val head: t -> commit_id option Lwt.t
  (** [head t] is the current head of the store [t]. This works for
      both persistent and temporary stores. In the case of a

      with the branch's ID, so this may block. In the case of a

    locally, otherwise it performs a fetch: in this case, only

    {3 Mergeable logs}

    We will demonstrate the use of custom merge operators by
    defining mergeable debug log files. We first define a log entry
    as a pair of a timestamp and a message, using the combinator
    exposed by {{:https://github.com/mirage/mirage-tc}mirage-tc}:

{[
  module Entry = struct
    include Tc.Pair (Tc.Int)(Tc.String)
    let compare (x, _) (y, _) = Pervasives.compare x y
    let time = ref 0
    let create message = incr time; !time, message
  end
]}

    A log file is a list of entries (one per line), ordered by
    decreasing order of timestamps. The 3-way [merge] operator for log
    files concatenates and sorts the new entries and prepend them
    to the common ancestor's ones.

{[
  module Log: Irmin.Contents.S with type t = Entry.t list = struct
    module Path = Irmin.Path.String_list
    module S = Tc.List(Entry)
    include S

    (* Get the timestamp of the latest entry. *)
    let timestamp = function
      | [] -> 0
      | (timestamp, _ ) :: _ -> timestamp

    (* Compute the entries newer than the given timestamp. *)
    let newer_than timestamp entries =
      let rec aux acc = function
        | [] -> List.rev acc
        | (h, _) :: _ when h <= timestamp -> List.rev acc
        | h::t -> aux (h::acc) t
      in
      aux [] entries

    let merge_log _path ~old t1 t2 =
      let open Irmin.Merge.OP in
      old () >>| fun old ->
      let old = match old with None -> [] | Some o -> o in
      let ts = timestamp old in
      let t1 = newer_than ts t1 in
      let t2 = newer_than ts t2 in
      let t3 = List.sort Entry.compare (List.rev_append t1 t2) in
      ok (List.rev_append t3 old)

    let merge path = Irmin.Merge.option (module S) (merge_log path)

  end
]}

    {b Note:} The serialisation primitives provided by
    {{:https://github.com/mirage/mirage-tc}mirage-tc}: are not very
    efficient in this case as they parse the file every-time. For real
    usage, you would write buffered versions of [Log.read] and
    [Log.write].

    To persist the log file on disk, we need to choose a backend. We
    show here how to use the on-disk [Git] backend on Unix.

{[
  (* Bring [Irmin_unix.task] and [Irmin_unix.Irmin_git] in scope. *)
  open Irmin_unix

  (* Build an Irmin store containing log files. *)
  module S = Irmin_git.FS(Log)(Irmin.Ref.String)(Irmin.Hash.SHA1)

  (* Set-up the local configuration of the Git repository. *)
  let config = Irmin_git.config ~root:"/tmp/irmin/test" ~bare:true ()
]}

  We can now define a toy example to use our mergeable log files.

{[
  open Lwt

  (* Name of the log file. *)
  let file = [ "local"; "debug" ]

  (* Read the entire log file. *)
  let read_file t =
    S.read (t "Reading the log file") file >>= function
    | None   -> return_nil
    | Some l -> return l

  (* Persist a new entry in the log. *)
  let log t fmt =
    Printf.ksprintf (fun message ->
        read_file t >>= fun logs ->
        let logs = Entry.create message :: logs in
        S.update (t "Adding a new entry") file logs
      ) fmt

  let () =
    Lwt_unix.run begin
      S.Repo.create config >>= S.master task
      >>= fun t  -> log t "Adding a new log entry"
      >>= fun () -> Irmin.clone_force task (t "Cloning the store") "x"
      >>= fun x  -> log x "Adding new stuff to x"
      >>= fun () -> log x "Adding more stuff to x"
      >>= fun () -> log x "More. Stuff. To x."
      >>= fun () -> log t "I can add stuff on t also"
      >>= fun () -> log t "Yes. On t!"
      >>= fun () -> Irmin.merge_exn "Merging x into t" x ~into:t

    same store, using the same internal keys format and a custom binary
    format based on {{:https://github.com/janestreet/bin_prot}bin_prot},
    with no native synchronization primitives: it is usually what is
    needed to quickly create a new backend.}
    {- {!Make_ext} creates a store with a {e deep} embedding of each
    of the internal stores into separate store, with a total control over
    the binary format and using the native synchronization protocols
    when available. This is mainly used by the Git backend, but could
    be used for other similar backends as well in the future.}
