(** Irmin public API.

    [Irmin] is a library to design and use persistent stores with
    built-in snapshot, branching and reverting mechanisms. Irmin uses
    concepts similar to {{:http://git-scm.com/}Git} but it exposes
    them as a high level library instead of a complex command-line
    frontend. It features a {e bidirectional} Git backend,
    fully-compatible with the usual Git tools and workflows.

    Irmin is designed to use a large variety of backends. It is
    written in pure OCaml and does not depend on external C stubs; it
    is thus very portable and aims is to run everywhere, from Linux to
    Xen unikernels.

    Consult the {!basics} and {!examples} of use for a quick
    start. See also the {{!Irmin_unix}documentation} for the unix
    backends.

        abstract value.

        @raise Invalid_argument if the string does not represent
        anything meaningful. *)

(** Tasks are used to keep track of the origin of reads and writes in
    the store. Every high-level operation is expected to have its own
    task, which is passed to every low-level calls. *)
module Task: sig

  (** {1 Task} *)

  include Tc.S0

  val create: date:int64 -> owner:string -> ?uid:int64 -> string -> t
  (** Create a new task. *)

  val date: t -> int64
  (** Get the task date.

      The date is computed by the user user when calling the
      {{!Task.create}create} function. When available,
      [Unix.gettimeofday ()] is a good value for such date. On more
      esoteric platforms, any monotonic counter is a fine value as
      well. On the Git backend, the date will be translated into the
      commit {e Date} field. *)

  val owner: t -> string
  (** Get the task owner.

      The owner identifies the entity (human, unikernel, process,
      thread, etc) performing an operation. For the Git backend, this
      will be directly translated into the {e Author} field. *)

  val uid: t -> int64
  (** Get the task unique identifier.

      By default, it is freshly generated on each call to
      {{!Task.create}create}. That identifier is useful for debugging
      purposes, for instance to relate debug lines to the tasks which
      cause them, and might appear in one line of the commit message
      for the Git backend. *)

  val messages: t -> string list
  (** Get the messages associated to the task.

      Text messages can be added to a task either at creation time,
      using {{!Task.create}create}, or can be appended on already
      created tasks using the {{!Task.add}add} function. For
      the Git backend, this will be translated to the commit
      message.  *)

  (** Use the merge function defined in another domain. If the
      converting functions raise any exception the merge is a

  val string: string t
  (** The default string merge function. Do not anything clever, just

  (** Lift a merge function to optional values of the same type. If all
      the provided values are inhabited, then call the provided merge
      function, otherwise use the same behavior as {!default}. *)

  val pair: 'a Tc.t -> 'b Tc.t -> 'a t -> 'b t -> ('a * 'b) t

      operations on counters are {e increment} and {e decrement}. The
      following merge functions ensure that the counter semantics is
      preserved: {e i.e.} it ensures that the number of increments and
      decrements is preserved. *)

  val counter: int t
  (** The merge function for mergeable counters. *)

  (** Multi-sets. *)
  module MSet (M: Map.S): sig
    val merge: counter M.t t

  (** {1 Maps and Association Lists} *)

  (** We consider that the only valid operations for maps and
      association lists are:

      {ul
      {- Adding a new bindings to the map.}
      {- Removing a binding from the map.}
      {- Replacing an existing binding with a different value.}
      {- {e Trying to add an already existing binding is a no-op}.}
      }

      We thus assume that no operation on maps is modifying the {e
      key} names. So the following merge functions ensures that {e
      (i)} new bindings are preserved {e (ii)} removed bindings stay
      removed and {e (iii)} modified bindings are merged using the
      merge function of values.

      {b Note:} We only consider sets of bindings, instead of
      multisets. Application developer should take care of concurrent
      adding and removal of similar bindings themselves, by using the
      appropriate {{!Merge.MSet}multi-sets}. *)

end

(** Branch-consistent stores. *)
module type BC = sig

  (** {1 Branch-consistent Store}

      Branch-consistent stores are hierarchical read-write stores with
      extended capabilities. They allow an application (or a
      collection of applications) to work with multiple local states,
      which can be forked and merged programmatically, whithout having
      to rely on a global state. In a way very similar to version
      control systems, Irmin local states are called {i branches}.

      They are two kinds of branches in Irmin: the
      {{!persistent}persistent} branches and the
      {{!temporary}temporary} ones. Branches exists relatively to a
      local, larger (and shared) store, and have some (shared)
      contents. This is exactly the same as usual version control
      systems, that the informed user can see as an implicit purely
      functional data-structure.

      {2:persistent Persistent Branches}

      A persistent branch always has a name. In Irmin, branch names
      are called {{!BC.tag}tags}. Thus, in order to use a persistent
      branch, you need to provide its name: see the {{!BC.of_tag}of_tag}
      function. *)

  include HRW
  (** A branch-consistent store is a hierarchical read-write store.

      [create config task] is a persistent branch using the
      {Tag.S.master} branch. This operation is cheap, can be repeated
      multiple times. *)

  type tag
  (** Type for persistent branch names. Tags usually share a common
      global namespace and that's the user responsibility to avoid
      name-clashes. *)

  val of_tag: config -> ('a -> task) -> tag -> ('a -> t) Lwt.t
  (** [create t tag] is the persistent branch named [tag]. Similar to
      [create], but use [tag] instead {!Tag.S.master}. *)

  val tag: t -> tag option Lwt.t
  (** [tag t] is [t]'s name. Return [None] if [t] is not
      persistent. *)

  val tag_exn: t -> tag Lwt.t
  (** Same as {!tag} but raise [Invalid_argument] if [t] is not
      persistent. *)

  val tags: t -> tag list Lwt.t
  (** The list of all persistent branch 's names. Similar to to [git
      branch -a].*)

  val remove_tag: t -> unit Lwt.t
  (** [remove_tag t] removes [t]'s name from the local store. Do
      nothing if [t] is not persistent. Similar to [git branch -D
      <current-branch>] *)

  val update_tag: t -> tag -> unit Lwt.t
  (** [update_tag t tag] updates [t]'s contents with the contents of
      the branch named [tag]. Can cause data losses as it discard the
      current contents. Similar to [git reset --hard <tag>]. *)

  val merge_tag: t -> ?max_depth:int -> ?n:int -> tag -> unit Merge.result Lwt.t
  (** [merge_tag t tag] merges the contents of the branch named [tag]
      into [t]'s. Similar to [git merge <tag>]. *)

  val merge_tag_exn: t -> ?max_depth:int -> ?n:int -> tag -> unit Lwt.t
  (** Same as {!merge_tag} but raise {!Merge.Conflict} in case of
      conflict. *)

  (** {2:temporary Temporary Branches}

      Temporary branches do not have stable names: instead they can be
      adressed using the hash of the current commit. These hashes are
      called {{!BC.head}heads} in Irmin. Temporary branches are
      similar to Git's detached heads. In a temporary branch, all the
      operations are done relatively to the current head and update
      operations can modify the current head: the branch current's
      head will automatically become the new head obtained while
      performing the update.

      Temporary branches are created using the {!BC.of_head}
      function. *)

  type head
  (** Type for temporary branches names. Similar to Git's commit
      SHA1s. *)

  val empty: config -> ('a -> task) -> ('a -> t) Lwt.t

      normal temporary branch after the first update. *)

  (** Create a temporary branch, using the given [head]. The branch
      will not persist as it has no persistent branch name. *)

  val head: t -> head option Lwt.t
  (** [head t] is the current head of the branch [t]. This works for
      both persistent and temporary branches. In the case of a
      persistent branch, this involves getting the the head associated
      with the branch's tag, so this might blocks. In the case of a
      temporary branch, simply return the current branch head. Return
      [None] is the branch has no contents. Similar to [git
      rev-parse HEAD]. *)

  val head_exn: t -> head Lwt.t
  (** Same as {!head} but raise [Invalid_argument] if the branch does
      not have any contents. *)

  val branch: t -> [`Tag of tag | `Head of head | `Empty]
  (** [branch t] is a representation of [t]'s branch. Can either be a
      persistent branch with a [tag] name, a temporary branch with a
      [head] commit or an empty temporary branch. *)

  val heads: t -> head list Lwt.t
  (** [heads t] is the list of all the heads in [t]'s store. Similar
      to [git rev-list --all]. *)

  val update_head: t -> head -> unit Lwt.t
  (** [update_head t h] updates [t]'s contents with the contents of
      the head [h]. Can cause data losses as it discards the current

    unit Merge.result Lwt.t
  (** [merge_head t ?max_head ?n head] merges the contents of the
      temporary branch associated to [head] into [t]. [max_depth] is

    {3 Synchronisation}

    A simple synchronization example, using the
    {{!Irmin_unix.Irmin_git}Git} backend and the {!Sync} helpers. The
    code clones a fresh repository if the repository does not exists
    locally, otherwise it performs a fetch: in this case, only
    the missing contents is downloaded.

    {3 Mergeable logs}

    We will demonstrate the use of custom merge operators by
    defining mergeable debug log files. We first define a log entry
    as a pair of a timestamp and a message, using the combinator
    exposed by {{:https://github.com/mirage/mirage-tc}mirage-tc}:

{[
  module Entry = struct
    include Tc.Pair (Tc.Int)(Tc.String)
    let compare (x, _) (y, _) = Pervasives.compare x y
    let time = ref 0
    let create message = incr time; !time, message
  end
]}

    A log file is a list of entries (one per line), ordered by
    decreasing order of timestamps. The 3-way [merge] operator for log
    files concatenates and sorts the new entries and prepend them
    to the common ancestor's ones.

{[
  module Log: Irmin.Contents.S with type t = Entry.t list = struct
    module Path = Irmin.Path.String_list
    module S = Tc.List(Entry)
    include S

    {b Note:} The serialization primitives provided by
    {{:https://github.com/mirage/mirage-tc}mirage-tc}: are not very
    efficient in this case as they parse the file every-time. For real
    usage, you would write buffered versions of [Log.read] and
    [Log.write].

    To persist the log file on disk, we need to choose a backend. We
    show here how to use the on-disk [Git] backend on Unix.

{[
  (* Bring [Irmin_unix.task] and [Irmin_unix.Irmin_git] in scope. *)

  (* Set-up the local configuration of the Git repository. *)
  let config = Irmin_git.config ~root:"/tmp/irmin/test" ~bare:true ()
]}

  We can now define a toy example to use our mergeable log files.

{[
  open Lwt

  let file = [ "local"; "debug" ]

  (* Read the entire log file. *)
  let read_file t =
    Irmin.read (t "Reading the log file") file >>= function
    | None   -> return_nil
    | Some l -> return l

  (* Persist a new entry in the log. *)
  let log t fmt =
    Printf.ksprintf (fun message ->
        read_file t >>= fun logs ->
        let logs = Entry.create message :: logs in
        Irmin.update (t "Adding a new entry") file logs
      ) fmt

  let () =
    Lwt_unix.run begin
      Irmin.create store config task
      >>= fun t  -> log t "Adding a new log entry"
      >>= fun () -> Irmin.clone_force task (t "Cloning the store") "x"
      >>= fun x  -> log x "Adding new stuff to x"
      >>= fun () -> log x "Adding more stuff to x"
      >>= fun () -> log x "More. Stuff. To x."
