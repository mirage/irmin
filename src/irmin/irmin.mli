(** Irmin public API.

    [Irmin] is a library to design and use persistent stores with built-in
    snapshot, branching and reverting mechanisms. Irmin uses concepts similar to
    {{:http://git-scm.com/} Git} but it exposes them as a high level library
    instead of a complex command-line frontend. It features a {e bidirectional}
    Git backend, where an application can read and persist its state using the
    Git format, fully-compatible with the usual Git tools and workflows.

    Irmin is designed to use a large variety of backends. It is written in pure
    OCaml and does not depend on external C stubs; it is thus very portable and
    aims to run everywhere, from Linux to browser and MirageOS unikernels.

    Consult the {!basics} and {!examples} of use for a quick start. See also the
    {{!Irmin_unix} documentation} for the unix backends.

    {e Release %%VERSION%% - %%HOMEPAGE%%} *)

val version : string
(** The version of the library. *)

(** {1 Preliminaries} *)

module Type = Type
(** Dynamic types for Irmin values. *)

module Info = Info
(** Commit info are used to keep track of the origin of write operations in the
    stores. [Info] models the metadata associated with commit objects in Git. *)

module Merge = Merge
(** [Merge] provides functions to build custom 3-way merge operators for various
    user-defined contents. *)

module Diff = Diff
(** Differences between values. *)

type 'a diff = 'a Diff.t
(** The type for representing differences betwen values. *)

(** {1 Low-level Stores} *)

(** An Irmin store is automatically built from a number of lower-level stores,
    each implementing fewer operations, such as {{!CONTENT_ADDRESSABLE_STORE}
    content-addressable} and {{!ATOMIC_WRITE_STORE} atomic-write} stores. These
    low-level stores are provided by various backends. *)

module type CONTENT_ADDRESSABLE_STORE = S.CONTENT_ADDRESSABLE_STORE
(** Content-addressable backend store. *)

module type APPEND_ONLY_STORE = S.APPEND_ONLY_STORE
(** Append-only backend store. *)

module type ATOMIC_WRITE_STORE = S.ATOMIC_WRITE_STORE
(** Atomic-write stores. *)

(** {1 User-Defined Contents} *)

(** Store paths.

    An Irmin {{!Irmin.S} store} binds {{!Path.S.t} paths} to user-defined
    {{!Contents.S} contents}. Paths are composed by basic elements, that we call
    {{!Path.S.step} steps}. The following [Path] module provides functions to
    manipulate steps and paths. *)
module Path : sig

  module type S = S.PATH
  (** Signature for path implementations.*)

  (** An implementation of paths as string lists. *)
  module String_list : S with type step = string and type t = string list
end

(** Hashing functions.

    [Hash] provides user-defined hash functions to digest serialized contents.
    Some {{!backend} backends} might be parameterized by such hash functions,
    others might work with a fixed one (for instance, the Git format uses only
    {{!Hash.SHA1} SHA1}).

    A {{!Hash.SHA1} SHA1} implementation is available to pass to the backends. *)
module Hash : sig
  (** {1 Contents Hashing} *)

  module type S = S.HASH
  (** Signature for hash values. *)

  module type TYPED = S.TYPED_HASH
  (** Signature for typed hashes, where [hash] directly takes a value as
      argument and incremental hashing is not possible. *)

  include module type of Hash
end

(** [Metadata] defines metadata that is attached to contents but stored in
    nodes. The Git backend uses this to indicate the type of file (normal,
    executable or symlink). *)
module Metadata : sig
  module type S = S.METADATA

  module None : S with type t = unit
  (** A metadata definition for systems that don't use metadata. *)
end

(** [Contents] specifies how user-defined contents need to be {e serializable}
    and {e mergeable}.

    The user needs to provide:

    - a type [t] to be used as store contents.
    - a value type for [t] (built using the {{!Irmin.Type} Irmin.Type}
      combinators).
    - a 3-way [merge] function, to handle conflicts between multiple versions of
      the same contents.

    Default implementations for {{!Contents.String} idempotent string} and
    {{!Contents.Json} JSON} contents are provided. *)
module Contents : sig
  module type S = S.CONTENTS

  module String : S with type t = string
  (** Contents of type [string], with the {{!Irmin.Merge.default} default} 3-way
      merge strategy: assume that update operations are idempotent and conflict
      iff values are modified concurrently. *)

  type json =
    [ `Null
    | `Bool of bool
    | `String of string
    | `Float of float
    | `O of (string * json) list
    | `A of json list ]

  module Json : S with type t = (string * json) list
  (** [Json] contents are associations from strings to [json] values stored as
      JSON encoded strings. If the same JSON key has been modified concurrently
      with different values then the [merge] function conflicts. *)

  (** [Json_value] allows any kind of json value to be stored, not only objects. *)

  module type S = S.BRANCH
  (** The signature for branches. Irmin branches are similar to Git branches:
      they are used to associated user-defined names to head commits. Branches
      have a default value: the {{!Branch.S.master} master} branch. *)

  module String : S with type t = string
  (** [String] is an implementation of {{!Branch.S} S} where branches are

      only alpha-numeric characters, [-], [_], [.], and [/]. *)

  module type STORE = S.BRANCH_STORE
  (** [STORE] specifies the signature for branch stores.

type config
(** The type for backend-specific configuration values.

    Every backend has different configuration options, which are kept abstract
    to the user. *)

    are just using the library (and not developing a new backend), you should
    not use this module. *)

(** {1 High-level Stores}

    An Irmin store is a branch-consistent store where keys are lists of steps.

    An example is a Git repository where keys are filenames, {e i.e.} lists of
    ['/']-separated strings. More complex examples are structured values, where
    steps might contain first-class field accessors and array offsets.

    Irmin provides the following features:

    - Support for fast clones, branches and merges, in a fashion very similar to
      Git.
    - Efficient staging areas for fast, transient, in-memory operations.
    - Fast {{!Sync} synchronization} primitives between remote stores, using
      native backend protocols (as the Git protocol) when available. *)

  (** {1 Irmin stores}

      Irmin stores are tree-like read-write stores with extended capabilities.
      They allow an application (or a collection of applications) to work with
      multiple local states, which can be forked and merged programmatically,
      without having to rely on a global state. In a way very similar to version
      control systems, Irmin local states are called {i branches}.

      There are two kinds of store in Irmin: the ones based on {{!persistent}
      persistent} named branches and the ones based {{!temporary} temporary}
      detached heads. These exist relative to a local, larger (and shared)
      store, and have some (shared) contents. This is exactly the same as usual
      version control systems, that the informed user can see as an implicit
      purely functional data-structure. *)

    A simple synchronization example, using the {{!Irmin_unix.Git} Git} backend
    and the {!Sync} helpers. The code clones a fresh repository if the
    repository does not exist locally, otherwise it performs a fetch: in this
    case, only the missing contents are downloaded.

    {3 Mergeable logs}

    We will demonstrate the use of custom merge operators by defining mergeable
    debug log files. We first define a log entry as a pair of a timestamp and a
    message, using the combinator exposed by {!Irmin.Type}:

    {[
      module Entry : sig
        include Irmin.Type.S

        val v : string -> t

        val timestamp : t -> int
      end = struct
        type t = { timestamp : int; message : string }

        let compare x y = compare x.timestamp y.timestamp

        let time = ref 0

        let v message =
          incr time;
          { timestamp = !time; message }

        let timestamp t = t.timestamp

        let pp ppf { timestamp; message } =
          Fmt.pf ppf "%04d: %s" timestamp message

        let of_string str =
          match String.split_on_char '\t' str with
          | [] -> Error (`Msg ("invalid entry: " ^ str))
          | ts :: msg_sects -> (
              let message = String.concat "\t" msg_sects in
              try Ok { timestamp = int_of_string ts; message }
              with Failure e -> Error (`Msg e) )

        let t =
          let open Irmin.Type in
          record "entry" (fun t32 message ->
              { timestamp = Int32.to_int t32; message })
          |+ field "timestamp" int32 (fun t -> Int32.of_int t.timestamp)
          |+ field "message" string (fun t -> t.message)

        let t = Irmin.Type.like ~cli:(pp, of_string) ~compare t
      end
    ]}

    A log file is a list of entries (one per line), ordered by decreasing order
    of timestamps. The 3-way [merge] operator for log files concatenates and
    sorts the new entries and prepend them to the common ancestor's ones.

    {[
      (* A log file *)
      module Log : sig
        include Irmin.Contents.S

        val add : t -> Entry.t -> t

        val empty : t
      end = struct
        type t = Entry.t list

        let empty = []

        let pp ppf l = List.iter (Fmt.pf ppf "%a\n" Entry.pp) (List.rev l)

        let of_string str =
          let lines = String.cuts ~empty:false ~sep:"\n" str in
          try
            List.fold_left
              (fun acc l ->
                match Entry.of_string l with
                | Ok x -> x :: acc

              [] lines
            |> fun l -> Ok l
          with Failure e -> Error (`Msg e)

        let t = Irmin.Type.(list Entry.t)

        let t = Irmin.Type.like' ~cli:(pp, of_string) t

        let timestamp = function [] -> 0 | e :: _ -> Entry.timestamp e

        let newer_than timestamp file =
          let rec aux acc = function
            | [] -> List.rev acc
            | h :: _ when Entry.timestamp h <= timestamp -> List.rev acc
            | h :: t -> aux (h :: acc) t
          in
          aux [] file

        let merge ~old t1 t2 =
          let open Irmin.Merge.Infix in
          old () >>=* fun old ->
          let old = match old with None -> [] | Some o -> o in
          let ts = timestamp old in
          let t1 = newer_than ts t1 in
          let t2 = newer_than ts t2 in

        let merge = Irmin.Merge.(option (v t merge))

        let add t e = e :: t
      end
    ]}

    {b Note:} The serialisation primitives used in that example are not very
    efficient in this case as they parse the file every time. For real usage,
    you would write buffered versions of [Log.pp] and [Log.of_string].

    To persist the log file on disk, we need to choose a backend. We show here
    how to use the on-disk [Git] backend on Unix.

    {[
      (* Build an Irmin store containing log files. *)
      module S = Irmin_unix.Git.FS.KV (Log)

      (* Set-up the commit info function *)
      let info fmt = Irmin_unix.info ~author:"logger" fmt
    ]}

    We can now define a toy example to use our mergeable log files.

      based on {{:https://github.com/janestreet/bin_prot} bin_prot}, with no
      native synchronization primitives: it is usually what is needed to quickly
      create a new backend.
    - {!Make_ext} creates a store with a {e deep} embedding of each of the
      internal stores into separate store, with total control over the binary
      format and using the native synchronization protocols when available. *)
