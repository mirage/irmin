module type S = sig
  (** Abstraction for irmin-pack's append only files (i.e. suffix and dict).

      It is parameterized with [Io], a file system abstraction (e.g. unix,
      mirage, eio_linux).

      It comprises a persistent file, an append buffer and take care of
      automatically shifting offsets to deal with legacy file headers. *)

  val create_rw :
    sw:Eio.Switch.t ->
    path:Eio.Fs.dir_ty Eio.Path.t ->
    overwrite:bool ->
    (t, [> Io.create_error ]) result
  (** Create a rw instance of [t] by creating the file at [path]. *)

  val open_rw :

    result
  (** Create a rw instance of [t] by opening an existing file at [path].

      {3 End Offset}

      The file has an end offset at which new data will be saved. While this
      information could be computed by looking at the size of the file, we
      prefer storing that information elsewhere (i.e. in the control file). This
      is why [open_rw] and [open_ro] take an [end_poff] parameter, and also why
      [refresh_end_poff] exists. The abstractions above [Append_only_file] are
      responsible for reading/writing the offsets from/to the control file.

      {3 [dead_header_size]}

      Designates a small area at the beginning of the file that should be
      ignored. The offsets start after that area.

      The actual persisted size of a file is [end_poff + dead_header_size].

      This concept exists in order to keep supporting [`V1] and [`V2] pack
      stores with [`V3]. *)

  val open_ro :
    sw:Eio.Switch.t ->
    path:Eio.Fs.dir_ty Eio.Path.t ->
    end_poff:int63 ->
    dead_header_size:int ->
    ( t,
      [> Io.open_error
      | `Closed
      | `Inconsistent_store
      | `Invalid_argument
      | `Read_out_of_bounds ] )
    result
  (** Create a ro instance of [t] by opening an existing file at [path] *)

  val close : t -> (unit, [> Io.close_error | `Pending_flush ]) result
  (** Close the underlying file.

      The internal buffer is expected to be in a flushed state when [close] is
      called. Otherwise, an error is returned. *)

  val end_poff : t -> int63
  (** [end_poff t] is the number of bytes of the file. That function doesn't
      perform IO.

      {3 RW mode}

      It also counts the bytes not flushed yet.

      {3 RO mode}

      This information originates from the latest reload of the control file.
      Calling [refresh_end_poff t] updates [end_poff]. *)

  val read_to_string :
    t -> off:int63 -> len:int -> (string, [> Io.read_error ]) result

  val read_exn : t -> off:int63 -> len:int -> bytes -> unit
  (** [read_exn t ~off ~len b] puts the [len] bytes of [t] at [off] to [b].

      [read_to_string] should always be favored over [read_exn], except when
      performences matter.

      It is not possible to read from an offset further than [end_poff t].

      Raises [Io.Read_error] and [Errors.Pack_error `Read_out_of_bounds].

      {3 RW mode}

      Attempting to read from the append buffer results in an
      [`Read_out_of_bounds] error. This feature could easily be implemented in
      the future if ever needed. *)

  val append_exn : t -> string -> unit
  (** [append_exn t ~off b] writes [b] to the end of [t]. Might trigger an auto
      flush.

      Grows [end_poff], but the parent abstraction is expected to persist this
      somewhere (e.g. in the control file).

      Post-condition: [end_poff t - end_poff (old t) = String.length b].

      Raises [Io.Write_error]

      {3 RW mode}

      Always raises [Errors.RO_not_allowed] *)

  val flush : t -> (unit, [> Io.write_error ]) result
  (** Flush the append buffer. Does not call [fsync].

      {3 RO mode}

      Always returns [Error `Ro_not_allowed]. *)

  val fsync : t -> (unit, [> Io.write_error ]) result
  (** Tell the os to fush its internal buffers. Does not call [flush].

      {3 RO mode}

      Always returns [Error `Ro_not_allowed]. *)

  val refresh_end_poff : t -> int63 -> (unit, [> `Rw_not_allowed ]) result
  (** Ingest the new end offset of the file. Typically happens in RO mode when
      the control file has been re-read.

      {3 RW mode}

      Always returns [Error `Rw_not_allowed]. *)
