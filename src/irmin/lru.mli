(** LRU cache implementation *)
module Make (H : Hashtbl.HashedType) : sig
  type 'a t

  val create : int -> 'a t
  (** [create n] returns a new LRU cache with the maximum size of [n]. If [n] is
      non-positive, the LRU cache is unbounded and is automatically internally
      resized. *)

  val add : 'a t -> H.t -> 'a -> unit
  (** [add t k v] adds the binding [k -> v] to the cache [t]. If the cache is
      full, the least recently used element is evicted. If [k] was already
      bound, its previous binding is replaced by [v] and it is marked as most
      recently used. *)

  val find : 'a t -> H.t -> 'a
  (** [find t k] returns the value associated with [k] in the cache [t], and
      marks [k] as most recently used. Raises [Not_found] if [k] is not bound in
      [t]. *)

  val mem : 'a t -> H.t -> bool
  (** [mem t k] checks if [k] is bound in the cache [t], and marks [k] as most
      recently used if it is. *)

  val clear : 'a t -> unit
  (** [clear t] removes all bindings from the cache [t]. *)

  val iter : 'a t -> (H.t -> 'a -> unit) -> unit
  (** [iter t f] calls [f k v] for all bindings in the cache [t]. *)

  val drop : 'a t -> 'a option
  (** [drop t] removes the least recently used binding from the cache [t] and
      returns its value, or [None] if the cache is empty. *)
