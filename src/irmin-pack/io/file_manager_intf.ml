module type S = sig
  (** Abstraction that governs the lifetime of the various files that are part
      of a pack store (except the branch store).

      The file manager (FM) handles the files one by one and makes explicit all
      the interactions between them (except the index which is handled from a
      high level API). This allows to gain confidence on SWMR consistency and
      crash consistency.

      {2 Two types of guarantees}

      Irmin_pack_unix supports the SWMR access scheme. It means that it is
      undefined for the files to be opened twice in RW mode by 2 FMs. It also
      means that it is undefined for a FM in RW mode to be used simultaneously
      from 2 different fibers.

      Irmin_pack_unix aims to be (crash) consistent (in the ACID sense). In case
      of a system failure (e.g. power outage), the files should be left in a
      consistent state for later uses.

      Ensuring SWMR consistency is easier than ensuring crash consistency
      because the of the OS's shared page cache.

      {2 Files mutations}

      Here are all the moments where the files managed may be mutated:

      - 1. During [create_rw].
      - 2. During [open_rw] if a major version upgrade is necessary.
      - 3. During the flush routines in file_manager.
      - 4. During a GC, from the worker.
      - 5. At the end of a GC, from the RW fiber, in [swap].
      - 6. During integrity check routines.

      1. 2. and 6. don't support SWMR and leave the store in an undefined state
      in case of crash.

      4. operates on files private to the worker. It doesn't necessitate to
      worry about crash concistency and SWMR.

      3. and 5. are highly critical. *)
