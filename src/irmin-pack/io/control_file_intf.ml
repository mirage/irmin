      (** The [`V3] payload of the irmin-pack control file. [`V3] is a major
          version. If [`V4] ever exists, it will have its own dedicated payload,
          but the [`V3] definition will still have to stick in the codebase for
          backward compatibilty of old pack stores.

          A store may only change its major version during an [open_rw] in
          [File_manager]. Note that upgrading a major version is the only reason
          why [open_rw] would modify files in an irmin-pack directory.

          For a given major version, the format of a payload may change, but
          only in a backward compatible way. I.e., all versions of irmin-pack
          should forever be able to decode a [`V3] control file, it allows for
          control file corruption and out-of-date code to be distinguishable.

          It is legal for the payload decoder to not fully consume the input
          buffer. Remaining bytes means that the definition of a payload was
          changed.
