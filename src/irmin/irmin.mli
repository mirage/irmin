(** Irmin public API.

    [Irmin] is a library to design and use persistent stores with
    built-in snapshot, branching and reverting mechanisms. Irmin uses
    concepts similar to {{:http://git-scm.com/}Git} but it exposes
    them as a high level library instead of a complex command-line
    frontend. It features a {e bidirectional} Git backend, where an
    application can read and persist its state using the Git format,
    fully-compatible with the usual Git tools and workflows.

    Irmin is designed to use a large variety of backends. It is
    written in pure OCaml and does not depend on external C stubs; it
    is thus very portable and aims to run everywhere, from Linux to
    browser and MirageOS unikernels.

    Consult the {!basics} and {!examples} of use for a quick
    start. See also the {{!Irmin_unix}documentation} for the unix
    backends.

  (** Yet-an-other type combinator library

      [Type] provides type combinators to define runtime
      representation for OCaml types and {{!generics}generic
      operations} to manipulate values with a runtime type
      representation.

      The type combinators supports all the usual {{!primitives}type
      primitives} but also compact definitions of {{!records}records}
      and {{!variants}variants}. It also allows to define the runtime
      representation of {{!recursive}recursive types}. *)

      {b TODO}: describe the limitations, e.g. only regular recursion

      about.

(** {1 High-level Stores}

    An Irmin store is a branch-consistent store where keys are lists
    of steps.

    An example is a Git repository where keys are filenames, {e i.e.}
    list of ['/']-separated strings. More complex examples are
    structured values, where steps might contain first-class field
    accessors and array offsets.

    Irmin provides the following features:

    {ul
    {- Support for fast clones, branches and merges, in a fashion very
       similar to Git.}
    {- Efficient taging areas for fast, transient, in-memory operations.}
    {- Fast {{!Sync}synchronization} primitives between remote
       stores, using native backend protocols (as the Git protocol)
       when available.}
    }
*)

  (** {1 Irmin stores}

      Irmin stores are tree-like read-write stores with
      extended capabilities. They allow an application (or a
      collection of applications) to work with multiple local states,
      which can be forked and merged programmatically, without having
      to rely on a global state. In a way very similar to version
      control systems, Irmin local states are called {i branches}.

      There are two kinds of store in Irmin: the ones based on
      {{!persistent}persistent} named branches and the ones based
      {{!temporary}temporary} detached heads. These exist relative to a
      local, larger (and shared) store, and have some (shared)
      contents. This is exactly the same as usual version control
      systems, that the informed user can see as an implicit purely
      functional data-structure. *)

    {3 Synchronization}

    A simple synchronization example, using the

    code clones a fresh repository if the repository does not exist
    locally, otherwise it performs a fetch: in this case, only
    the missing contents is downloaded.

    {3 Mergeable logs}

    We will demonstrate the use of custom merge operators by
    defining mergeable debug log files. We first define a log entry
    as a pair of a timestamp and a message, using the combinator
    exposed by {!Irmin.Type}:

{[
module Entry : sig
  include Irmin.Type.S
  val v: string -> t
  val timestamp: t -> int
end = struct

  type t = { timestamp: int; message : string; }

  let compare x y = compare x.timestamp y.timestamp

  let time = ref 0

  let v message =
    incr time;
    { timestamp = !time; message }

  let timestamp t = t.timestamp

  let pp ppf { timestamp; message } =
    Fmt.pf ppf "%04d: %s" timestamp message

  let of_string str =
    match String.split_on_char '\t' str with
    | [] -> Error (`Msg ("invalid entry: " ^ str))
    | ts :: msg_sects ->
      let message = String.concat "\t" msg_sects in
      try Ok { timestamp = int_of_string ts; message }
      with Failure e -> Error (`Msg e)

  let t =
    let open Irmin.Type in
    record "entry" (fun t32 message -> { timestamp = Int32.to_int t32; message })
    |+ field "timestamp" int32  (fun t -> Int32.of_int t.timestamp)
    |+ field "message"   string (fun t -> t.message)
    |> sealr

  let t = Irmin.type.like' ~cli:(pp, of_string) ~compare t

end
]}

    A log file is a list of entries (one per line), ordered by
    decreasing order of timestamps. The 3-way [merge] operator for log
    files concatenates and sorts the new entries and prepend them
    to the common ancestor's ones.

{[
(* A log file *)
module Log: sig
  include Irmin.Contents.S
  val add: t -> Entry.t -> t
  val empty: t
end = struct

  type t = Entry.t list

  let empty = []

  let pp ppf l = List.iter (Fmt.pf ppf "%a\n" Entry.pp ) (List.rev l)

  let of_string str =
    let lines = String.cuts ~empty:false ~sep:"\n" str in
    try
      List.fold_left (fun acc l ->
          match Entry.of_string l with
          | Ok x           -> x :: acc
          | Error (`Msg e) -> failwith e
        ) [] lines
      |> fun l -> Ok l
    with Failure e ->
      Error (`Msg e)

  let t = Irmin.Type.(list Entry.t)
  let t = Irmin.Type.like' ~cli:(pp, of_string) t

  let timestamp = function
    | [] -> 0
    | e :: _ -> Entry.timestamp e

  let newer_than timestamp file =
    let rec aux acc = function
      | [] -> List.rev acc
      | h:: _ when Entry.timestamp h <= timestamp -> List.rev acc
      | h::t -> aux (h::acc) t
    in
    aux [] file

  let merge ~old t1 t2 =
    let open Irmin.Merge.Infix in
    old () >>=* fun old ->
    let old = match old with None -> [] | Some o -> o in
    let ts = timestamp old in
    let t1 = newer_than ts t1 in
    let t2 = newer_than ts t2 in
    let t3 = List.sort Entry.compare (List.rev_append t1 t2) in
    Irmin.Merge.ok (List.rev_append t3 old)

  let merge = Irmin.Merge.(option (v t merge))

  let add t e = e :: t

end ]}

    {b Note:} The serialisation primitives used in that example are
    not very efficient in this case as they parse the file
    every-time. For real usage, you would write buffered versions of
    [Log.pp] and [Log.of_string].

    To persist the log file on disk, we need to choose a backend. We
    show here how to use the on-disk [Git] backend on Unix.

{[
  (* Build an Irmin store containing log files. *)
  module S = Irmin_unix.Git.FS.KV(Log)

  (* Set-up the local configuration of the Git repository. *)
  let config = Irmin_git.config ~bare:true "/tmp/irmin/test"

  (* Set-up the commit info function *)
  let info fmt = Irmin_unix.info ~author:"logger" fmt
]}

  We can now define a toy example to use our mergeable log files.

{[
  open Lwt.Infix

  (* Name of the log file. *)
  let file = [ "local"; "debug" ]

  (* Read the entire log file. *)
  let read_file t =
    S.find t file >|= function
    | None   -> []
    | Some l -> l

  (* Persist a new entry in the log. *)
  let log t fmt =
    Fmt.kstrf (fun message ->
        read_file t >>= fun logs ->
        let logs = Log.add logs (Entry.v message) in
        S.set t (info "Adding a new entry") file logs
      ) fmt

  let () =
    Lwt_main.run begin
      S.Repo.v config >>= S.master
      >>= fun t  -> log t "Adding a new log entry"
      >>= fun () -> Irmin.clone_force ~src:t ~dst:"x"
      >>= fun x  -> log x "Adding new stuff to x"
      >>= fun () -> log x "Adding more stuff to x"
      >>= fun () -> log x "More. Stuff. To x."
      >>= fun () -> log t "I can add stuff on t also"
      >>= fun () -> log t "Yes. On t!"
      >>= fun () -> S.merge (info "Merging x into t") x ~into:t
