# Contribute to Irmin

## License

Irmin is distributed under the ISC license. Every OCaml source file
should start with a header comment instantiating the following
template (use appropriate comment syntax for other languages):

```

```

Note that:

- The holder, on the copyright line, is the name of individual
  contributors and/or their company;
- When adding a significant new contribution to a file (i.e. more like
  whole new features, rather than simple fixes), check whether there
  already is a copyright for your copyright holder (see above):
  - If there is one, mentioning any year, it is not required to add
    the current year (but this is allowed). In no case should you
    replace the existing year with the current one.
  - If there is no line for your copyright holder, you should add one,
    with the current year.

For example, for a source file with multiple contributors spanning
several years, the copyright lines may look as follows:
