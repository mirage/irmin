(** The implementation of last-write-wins register. The value to be stored in
    the register and the timestamp method are provided by the user.

    Merge semantics: The value with the largest timestamp is chosen. If two
    values have the same timestamp, then the larger value is selected based on
    the compare specified by the user. *)

module type S = sig
  module Store : Irmin.KV
  (** Content store of the register. All store related operations like
      branching, cloning, merging, etc are done through this module. *)

  type value
  (** Type of values stored in the register *)

  val read : path:Store.path -> Store.t -> value option
  (** Reads the value from the register. Returns [None] if no value is written
  *)

  val write : ?info:Store.Info.f -> path:Store.path -> Store.t -> value -> unit
  (** Writes the provided value to the register *)

    other parameters as specified by the user. *)
