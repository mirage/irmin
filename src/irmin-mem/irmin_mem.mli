(** In-memory store.

    A simple in-memory store, using hash tables. Once one of the
    functors below is instantiated to a module [M], it has a unique
    shared hash-table: multiple invocation of [M.create] will see and
    manipulate the same contents. *)

val config : unit -> Irmin.config
(** Configuration values. *)

(** An in-memory store for append-only values. *)

module Atomic_write : Irmin.ATOMIC_WRITE_STORE_MAKER
(** An in-memory store with atomic-write guarantees. *)

module Make : Irmin.S_MAKER
