  module type S = S
  (** The signature for branches. Irmin branches are similar to Git branches:
      they are used to associated user-defined names to head commits. Branches
      have a default value: the {{!Branch.S.master} master} branch. *)

  module String : S with type t = string
  (** [String] is an implementation of {{!Branch.S} S} where branches are
      strings. The [master] branch is ["master"]. Valid branch names contain
      only alpha-numeric characters, [-], [_], [.], and [/]. *)

  module type Store = Store
  (** [Store] specifies the signature for branch stores.

      A {i branch store} is a mutable and reactive key / value store, where keys
      are branch names created by users and values are keys are head commmits. *)
