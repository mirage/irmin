  (** [create_one_commit_store t key path] creates a new store at [path] from
      the existing one, containing only one commit, specified by the [key]. Note
      that this operation is blocking.

      It requires that the files existing on disk when the operation is
      launched, remain on disk until the operation completes. In particular, a
      Gc running in a different process could remove files from disk. *)

    val start_exn : ?unlink:bool -> repo -> commit_key -> bool Lwt.t
    (** [start_exn] tries to start the GC process and returns true if the GC is
        launched. If a GC is already running, a new one is not started.

        The GC process will not be automatically finalised. The caller is
        responsible for calling {!finalise_exn}.

        If [unlink] is false then temporary files and files from the previous
        generation will be kept on disk after the GC finished. This option is
        useful for debugging. The default is [true].

        TODO: Detail exceptions raised. *)

    val finalise_exn : ?wait:bool -> repo -> process_state Lwt.t
    (** [finalise_exn ?wait repo] waits for the GC process to finish in order to
        finalise it. It returns the state of the GC process from the point of
        view of the function call; subsequent calls of [finalise_exn] after a
        return of [`Finalised] will return [`Idle].

        Finalising consists of mutating [repo] so that it points to the new file
        and to flush the internal caches that could be referencing GCed objects.

        If [wait = true] (the default), the call blocks until the GC process
        finishes. If [wait = false], finalisation will occur if the process has
        ended.

        If there are no running GCs, the call is a no-op and it returns [`Idle].

        discarding all data prior to [commit_key]. If a GC process is already
        running, a new one will not be started.

        [run] will also finalise the GC process automaticlly. For more detailed
        control, see {!start_exn} and {!finalise_exn}.

        When the GC process is finalised, [finished] is called with the result
        of finalisation.

        Returns whether a GC process successfully started or not.

        All exceptions that [Irmin_pack] knows how to handle are caught and

    (** [export ?on_disk repo f ~root_key] applies [f] to all inodes and
        contents in a rooted tree, with root specified by [root_key].

        The traversal requires an index to keep track of visited elements.

        - if [on_disk] is not specified, the index is in memory.
        - if [on_disk] is [`Path path], a temporary index is created at path.

        The traversal order is stable. In [Inode_tree], it is lexicographic on
        the [index] function (see {!Conf.inode_child_order}). In [Inode_value],
        it is lexicographic on the steps.

        [f] is called in post-order, that is [f] is first called on the leaves,
        and the last call to [f] is on the root designated by [root_key].

        The traversal skips objects that are structurally equal to objects that
        were already traversed. In other words, [export] internally uses a hash
        set in order to guarantee that all the objects passed to [f] don't hash
        the same way.
