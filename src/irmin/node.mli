(** [Node] provides functions to describe the graph-like structured values.

    The node blocks form a labeled directed acyclic graph, labeled by
    {{!Path.S.step} steps}: a list of steps defines a unique path from one node
    to an other.

    Each node can point to user-defined {{!Contents.S} contents} values. *)
