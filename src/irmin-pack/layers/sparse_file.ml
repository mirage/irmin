(** A sparse file is "a file containing gaps"; the gaps do not take up space on disk.

The implementation uses a normal "data" file for the non-gap data, and a "map" file, which
is used to translate "addresses in the sparse file" (aka "virtual addresses") to
"addresses in the data file".

The prototype, which includes extensive documentation, can be found at {{: https://github.com/tomjridge/sparse-file/}}.

      A new map entry [virt_off -> (real_off,len)] is added, where [real_off] is the
      offset of the end of the sparse data file before the append took place.

      NOTE [len] must not be 0; no other validity checks are made on [off] and [len]. It
      is possible to add the same region multiple times for example, or add overlapping

      updating [off] and returning the number of bytes read.

      A read that extends beyond the end of a data region will be supplemented with dummy
      bytes (this scenario is allowed with irmin-pack because often the user does not know
      how many bytes to read, so they read more than is strictly necessary and then
      examine the bytes they have read to try to decode an object).

      A read that starts in an empty region will fill the buffer with dummy bytes (this
      scenario is almost certainly an error case, so we could instead throw an
      exception).  *)

  (** 

When we try to find a (virt_off,len) region within the sparse file, there are various
possibilities. We first find the largest voff' smaller-or-equal-to virt_off for which
there exists entry [(voff',(roff',len'))] in the map. Then we have the following
possibilities:

- No entry found: The first data region starts beyond [virt_off]; this is "starts in gap"

- Within: (line shows relative relationships between 4 positions)

{v
----------------------------------------------
  ^voff'  ^virt_off  ^virt_off+len  ^voff'+len'
v}

In this case we can safely read the entirety of the data.

- Starts in gap:

{v
----------------------------------------
  ^voff' ^voff'+len' ^virt_off
v}

- Extends beyond:

{v
----------------------------------------------
  ^voff'  ^virt_off  ^voff'+len'  ^virt_off+len 
v}

In this case, we can only read some of the data, and we pad the rest with dummy bytes.
