(*  Paths are randomly built following a restrictive pattern to increase chance of collision: the name of the next step of the path iss built with the characters "a", "b" and "c" only with the following logic:
      - at the root level, the possible names are "a", "b" and "c"
      - at any other level, the possible names are the concatenation of the name of the parent directory with "a", "b" or "c" (chosen randomly)

      The content is simply a string.
