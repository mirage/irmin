      known to have been created using [irmin_pack_version = `V2] or more. The
      entries before that point may be v1 entries. V1 entries need an entry in
      index because it is the only place their lenght is stored. *)

  [@@deriving irmin]
  (** [entry_offset_suffix_start] is 0 if the suffix file was never garbage
      collected. Otherwise it is the offset of the very first entry of the
      suffix file. Note that offsets in the suffix file are virtual. The garbage
      collections don't reset the offsets.

      [generation] is the number of past GCs. A suffix file, a prefix file and a
      mapping containing that integer in their filename exist. *)

  (** [From_v1_v2_post_upgrade] corresponds to a pack store that was upgraded to
      [`V3]. It contains infos related to backward compatibility. GCs are
      forbidden on it.

      [From_v3] corresponds to a pack store that was created using [`V3] code.
      It never underwent a GC.

      [From_v3_used_non_minimal_indexing_strategy] corresponds to a pack store
      that was created using [`V3] code. It never underwent a GC and it will
      never be possible to GC it because entries were pushed using a non-minimal
      indexing strategy.

      The [T*] tags are provisional tags that the binary decoder is aware of and
      that may in the future be used to add features to the [`V3] payload. *)

  (** The [`V3] payload of the irmin-pack control file. [`V3] is a major
      version. If [`V4] ever exists, it will have its own dedicated payload, but
      the [`V3] definition will still have to stick in the codebase for backward
      compatibilty of old irmin-pack directories.

      A store may only change its major version during an [open_rw] in
      [File_manager]. Note that upgrading a major version is the only reason why
      [open_rw] would modify files in an irmin-pack directory.

      For a given major version, the format of a payload may change, but only in
      a backward compatible way. I.e., all versions of irmin-pack should forever
      be able to decode a [`V3] control file, it allows for control file
      corruption and out-of-date code to be distinguishable.

      It is legal for the payload decoder to not fully consume the input buffer.
      Remaining bytes means that the definition of a payload was changed.

      {3 Fields}

      [dict_offset_end] is the offset in the dict file just after the last valid
      dict bytes. The next data to be pushed to the dict will be pushed at this
      offset.

      [entry_offset_suffix_end] is similar to [dict_offset_end] but for the
      suffix file.

      [status] is a variant that encode the state of the irmin-pack directory.
      This field MUST be the last field of the record, in order to allow
      extensions *)
