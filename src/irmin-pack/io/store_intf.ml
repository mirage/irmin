        The GC process will not be automatically finalised. The caller is
        responsible for calling {!finalise_exn}.

        If [unlink] is false then temporary files and files from the previous
        generation will be kept on disk after the GC finished. This option is
        useful for debugging. The default is [true].

    val finalise_exn : ?wait:bool -> repo -> process_state

        view of the function call; subsequent calls of [finalise_exn] after a
        return of [`Finalised] will return [`Idle].

        Finalising consists of mutating [repo] so that it points to the new file
        and to flush the internal caches that could be referencing GCed objects.
        What is done with the discarded data depends on {!behaviour}.

        If [wait = true] (the default), the call blocks until the GC process
        finishes. If [wait = false], finalisation will occur if the process has
        ended.

        If there are no running GCs, the call is a no-op and it returns [`Idle].

    (** [export ?on_disk repo f ~root_key] applies [f] to all inodes and
        contents in a rooted tree, with root specified by [root_key].

        The traversal requires an index to keep track of visited elements.

        - if [on_disk] is not specified, the index is in memory.
        - if [on_disk] is [`Path path], a temporary index is created at path.

        The traversal order is stable. In [Inode_tree], it is lexicographic on
        the [index] function (see {!Conf.inode_child_order}). In [Inode_value],
        it is lexicographic on the steps.

        [f] is called in post-order, that is [f] is first called on the leaves,
        and the last call to [f] is on the root designated by [root_key].

        The traversal skips objects that are structurally equal to objects that
        were already traversed. In other words, [export] internally uses a hash
        set in order to guarantee that all the objects passed to [f] don't hash
        the same way.
