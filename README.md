## Irminsule

Irminsule is a distributed filesystem and block store that follows the
same design principles as Git. The design consists of three main
components:

* a low-level immutable and consistent key/value data-store
* a DAG persisted in that datastore; and
* a tag store which associate names to keys of the low-level data-store.

Irminsule is written in pure OCaml, and can thus be compiled to a
variety of backends (including Javascript, and Mirage
microkernels). Unlike the git frontend, applications can directly
iterate over the object graph.

The immutability of the low-level block store makes it significantly
easier to apply replication and network coding techniques to improve
resilience via replication, and to optimise scheduling across many
hosts using MPTCP-style congestion control.
