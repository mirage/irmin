      --------------------------
     | uint8_t type             | 
     ---------------------------
     | uint16_t chunck_length   |
     ---------------------------
     | byte data[data_length]   |
     ---------------------------
     Where type define if the chunck contain data or indirection, size represent the data length to 
     consider, and data field is the payload.
