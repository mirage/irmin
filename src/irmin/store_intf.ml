  (** {1 Irmin stores}

      Irmin stores are tree-like read-write stores with extended capabilities.
      They allow an application (or a collection of applications) to work with
      multiple local states, which can be forked and merged programmatically,
      without having to rely on a global state. In a way very similar to version
      control systems, Irmin local states are called {i branches}.

      There are two kinds of store in Irmin: the ones based on {{!persistent}
      persistent} named branches and the ones based {{!temporary} temporary}
      detached heads. These exist relative to a local, larger (and shared)
      store, and have some (shared) contents. This is exactly the same as usual
      version control systems, that the informed user can see as an implicit
      purely functional data-structure. *)

        [min] is not specified, use an unbound past (but can still be limited by
        [depth]).

        [depth] is used to limit the depth of the commit history. [None] here
        means no limitation.

        If [full] is set (default is true), the full graph, including the
        commits, nodes and contents, is exported, otherwise it is the commit

  (** [of_commit c] is a temporary store, based on the commit [c].

      Temporary stores do not have stable names: instead they can be addressed

      performed relative to the current head and update operations can modify

    (** [find t] is the current head of the store [t]. This works for both
        persistent and temporary branches. In the case of a persistent branch,
        this involves getting the the head associated with the branch, so this
        may block. In the case of a temporary store, it simply returns the
        current head. Returns [None] if the store has no contents. Similar to
